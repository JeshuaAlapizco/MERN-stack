## How TO Use
   Download or clone the whole project 
   I have created the app using two ways **(With and Without flux(Redux.js)** architecture and you can use either of them
   ##### WithOut flux
      1. Simply paste the project without the ` redux(option) ` folder
      2. open two terminal - one for node.js server and one for webpack compilation
      3. After pasting the project run ` npm install ` to install all the dependencies 
      4 In one terminal run ` nodemon server.js ` to start the server .
      5 before running the server just compile the webpack with ` npm run webpack ` though I will update the bundle.js file as much as              possible
      6  Go to **http://localhost:8080/** to see the page
   ##### With flux( I am using redux.js )
      1. Simply paste the project including the ` redux(option) ` folder
      2. replace the app.js and bundle.js in project directory with the same named file from the redux folder and also change the                    components/body.js file with the redux/body.js
      3. After pasting the project and changing the above changes  run ` npm install ` to install all the dependencies 
      4 In one terminal run ` nodemon server.js ` to start the server .
      5 before running the server just compile the webpack with ` npm run webpack ` though I will update the bundle.js file as much as              possible
      6  Go to **http://localhost:8080/** to see the page
